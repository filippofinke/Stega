## About The Project

This project is a simple steganography tool that allows you to hide text within images. It provides methods to hide text in an image file and retrieve hidden text from an image file. The hiding process is done by modifying the least significant bit of each byte in the image, allowing for minimal visual impact on the image itself.

## Getting Started

To use this steganography tool, you can download the source code and compile it using Java. 

To compile it using maven, run the following command:

```sh
mvn clean package
```

The main class is `Main`, which provides methods for hiding and revealing text. You can run the program from the command line with the following options:

- To hide text: `java -jar stega.jar "text" sourceImage destinationImage`
- To reveal text: `java -jar stega.jar sourceImage`

Replace `stega.jar` with the name of the compiled JAR file.

Otherwise you can double click the JAR file to run the program with a GUI.
